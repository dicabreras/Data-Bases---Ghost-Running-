# 👻 Ghost Running Database Project 🏃‍♀️

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository holds the comprehensive database solution for **"Ghost Running,"** a conceptual fitness software. 

The project was developed as the core requirement for the Data Bases class, demonstrating a hands-on application of relational database principles from modeling through implementation.

## 🛠️ Key Components & Technologies

| Component | Description | Technology |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Relational Model** | Detailed conceptual and logical design of the database schema. | **MySQL Workbench** (EER Diagrams) |
| **Schema Implementation** | SQL code for defining and creating all necessary tables and constraints. | **SQL (DDL)** |
| **Data Manipulation** | Scripts for populating the database and executing various analytical queries. | **SQL (DML)** |
| **Query Analysis** | Practice in formulating complex queries to extract meaningful insights from the data. | **SQL** |

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

The primary goal of this project was to:
* Successfully **model a real-world entity** into a normalized Relational Model.
* Master the translation of the conceptual model into a functioning database structure.
* Gain proficiency in writing **production-ready SQL** for data insertion, updates, and complex data retrieval.
